TEST FAILED: 

    User 1 shared a file
    User 1 stop sharing file
    User 2 list_files g  => tracker will response "img.png"
    User 2 download file => segfault because there is no ip:port at last

Assumtion 1:

    If someone has even a single piece of file then tracker will that user as he is sharing a file
    But that doesn't mean user will be able to download entire file
